### Hi 👋

I'm Ben. I'm a principal engineer at [Humanitec](https://www.humanitec.com) working mostly in Go, and building the backend services that hold our platform orchestrator together.

On the side I work on a bunch of random side projects, and you can read about my personal projects on [bensblog.meierhost.com](https://bensblog.meierhost.com/). I'm generally using Go for productivity reasons but also work in Rust, Java, and web technologies as appropriate.

See the pinned projects below for the things that are most polished or worth checking out ⬇️. But don't take them too seriously! 😆
