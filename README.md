### Hi 👋

I'm Ben. I'm a developer at [Humanitec](https://www.humanitec.com) working mostly in Go, and building the backend services that hold our platform orchestrator together.

I work on a bunch of random side projects most of the time, and you can read about my personal projects on [bensblog.meierhost.com](https://bensblog.meierhost.com/).

See the pinned projects below for the things that are most polished or worth checking out ⬇️.
